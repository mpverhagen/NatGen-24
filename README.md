# The non-stem origin of colon cancer in the context of inflammation 

Cell-of-origin predictions were performed with [COOBoostR](https://github.com/SWJ9385/COOBoostR) and with epigenetic profiles from [Becker et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01088-x).

Files contain R scripts for:
- Pre-processing of single-cell ATAC data with [Signac](https://stuartlab.org/signac/)
- Pre-processing of WGS mutation count data from [Rajam√§ki et al.](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(21)00680-6/fulltext) 
- Settings for cell-of-origin predictions using [COOBoostR](https://github.com/SWJ9385/COOBoostR)
